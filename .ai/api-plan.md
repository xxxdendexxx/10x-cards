# REST API Plan

## 1. Resources

1. **Users**
   - Database Table: `users`
   - Description: Managed by Supabase Auth. Contains user information including email, encrypted_password, and creation timestamps. This resource is used for authentication and account management.

2. **Flashcards**

    ```
  - **Response (200):** Updated user data

  - **Method:** GET
  - **URL:** /api/generation-error-logs
  - **Description:** Retrieve generation error logs for the authenticated user.
  - **Response (200):**

    ```
  - **Errors:**
    - 401 Unauthorized

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Mechanism:** Token-based authentication using Supabase Auth (JWT tokens).
- **Enforcement:** Every endpoint (except those for public information, if any) requires valid authentication headers. Middleware will verify that the auth token's user ID matches the resource's user_id (using Row Level Security as configured in the database).
- **Additional Measures:** Rate limiting should be applied at the API gateway level to prevent abuse.

## 4. Validation and Business Logic

- **Input Validation:**
  - Flashcard fields: 
    - 'front' is limited to 200 characters
    - 'back' is limited to 500 characters
    - 'source' must be one of ["ai-full", "ai-edited", "manual"]
    - 'generation_id' is required for ai-full and ai-edited sources, must be null for manual
  - Pagination parameters:
    - 'pageSize' must be between 1 and 100
    - 'page' must be â‰¥ 1
  - AI Generation Input: Validate that the provided source text meets expected length criteria (typically between 1000 and 10000 characters) as enforced in the generations table.
- **Business Logic:**
  - **AI Flashcard Generation:** The process involves accepting a raw text, generating flashcard proposals via an AI service, returning them to the client for review, and then confirming and persisting acceptable proposals. A generation log is recorded to track usage statistics.
  - **User Ownership:** Modifications and deletions of flashcards (and access to logs) are restricted to flashcards that belong to the authenticated user.
  - **Soft Deletion:** Flashcards are soft-deleted by setting the is_deleted flag to true.
  - **Study Session Handling:** Integration with an external spaced repetition algorithm; flashcard ratings are submitted to adjust the review schedule.

## Assumptions

- The frontend will handle additional logic for editing AI-generated flashcards before confirmation.
- Account management (registration, password changes) is primarily handled by Supabase Auth, but minimal proxy endpoints may be provided.
- Error responses follow a standardized JSON structure with an error code and message.
